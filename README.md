# Pedestrian-Detection
**Description:**
This project implements a People Detection System using computer vision techniques. It utilizes the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) detector along with non-maximum suppression to detect people in images and videos. Additionally, a graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

**Features:**

Detect people in images and videos.
Real-time processing for video streams.
Graphical User Interface for easy interaction.
Optimized for accuracy and computational efficiency.
Requirements:

Python 3.x
OpenCV
NumPy
Imutils (for resizing images)

**Usage:**
**Run the GUI:**

Copy code
python gui.py
Use the GUI to select an image or video file.
Click the "Detect People" button to start the detection process.
View the detected people in the output window.
**Acknowledgments:**

This project was inspired by the need for efficient people detection systems in various domains.
Special thanks to the contributors of OpenCV and other libraries used in this project.
